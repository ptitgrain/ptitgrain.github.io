# This is the code for the public website of P'tit Grain

The website is hosted on Github pages and uses the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is supported by [Github pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).

## Theme ##

I started with the [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme) and adapted it where needed.

## Customization ##

Below are some of the customizations I have made to the original template.  
The list is not complete but gives a decent overview of the work I have done. 

### Contact form ###

The contact form uses a Google Form.  
I followed the instructions [Google Form Customization for Static Websites!](https://blog.webjeda.com/google-form-customize/) to build the Google Form and integrate it into the Agency jekyll Theme.  
I needed to change the Javascript in the file *contact_me.js*.

### Legal ###

The legal text is translated to Dutch.

### General Conditions ###

Added a General Conditions page (content is a work in progress) with a link in the footer.

### Home page content ###

I changed the order of the sections on the home layout to better match with our needs.

The *services section* is extended with a *end* part. This is used to show the rate information.
